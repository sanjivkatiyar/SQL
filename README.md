###Constraints

- **NOT NULL Constraint:** Ensures that a column cannot have NULL value.
- **DEFAULT Constraint:** Provides a default value for a column when none is
specified.
- **UNIQUE Constraint:** Ensures that all values in a column are different.
- **CHECK Constraint:** Makes sure that all values in a column satisfy certain
criteria.
- **Primary Key Constraint:** Used to uniquely identify a row in the table.
- **Foreign Key Constraint:** Used to ensure referential integrity of the data.

###Keys

- A ***primary key*** is used to uniquely identify each row in a table.
- A ***primary key*** can consist of one or more columns on a table.
- When multiple columns are used as a primary key, they are called a
  ***composite key***.
- A ***foreign key*** is a column (or columns) that references a column (most often
the primary key) of another table.
- The purpose of the ***foreign key*** is to ensure referential integrity of the data.
